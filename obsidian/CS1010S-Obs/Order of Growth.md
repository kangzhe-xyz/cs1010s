# Motivation
We consider the [[Time Complexity]] and [[Space Complexity]] of a program.
In particular, we are concerned about the **growth** of the complexity. 
# Main Question
If we increase the input, how much more time/space does it take up?
## Subquestions
> Which primitives require time?

Every operation!

> Which primitives require space?

Variables!
